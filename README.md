## Pitch Classifier

The goal of this project was to use MLB Statcast data to build a model which could classify the pitches of some of the MLB's best pitchers. Every pitch a pitcher throws has a different speed, spin rate, and spin axis, and my goal was to build a model which could use these qualities to output the type of pitch which was thrown.
